Romance is the privilege of the rich, not the profession of the unemployed. The poor should be practical and prosaic. It is better to have a permanent income than to be fascinating. These are the great truths of modern life which Hughie Erskine never realised. Poor Hughie! Intellectually, we must admit, he was not of much importance. He never said a brilliant or even an ill-natured thing in his life. But then he was wonderfully good-looking, with his crisp brown hair, his clear-cut profile, and his grey eyes. He was as popular with men as he was with women, and he had every accomplishment except that of making money. His father had bequeathed him his cavalry sword, and a History of the Peninsular War in fifteen volumes. Hughie hung the first over his looking-glass, put the second on a shelf between Ruff's Guide and Bailey's Magazine, and lived on two hundred a year that an old aunt allowed him. He had tried everything. He had gone on the Stock Exchange for six months; but what was a butterfly to do among bulls and bears? He had been a tea-merchant for a little longer, but had soon tired of pekoe and souchong. Then he had tried selling dry sherry. That did not answer; the sherry was a little too dry. Ultimately he became nothing, a delightful, ineffectual young man with a perfect profile and no profession.\n\nTo make matters worse, he was in love. The girl he loved was Laura Merton, the daughter of a retired Colonel who had lost his temper and his digestion in India, and had never found either of them again. Laura adored him, and he was ready to kiss her shoe-strings. They were the handsomest couple in London, and had not a penny-piece between them. The Colonel was very fond of Hughie, but would not hear of any engagement.","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"Page 1","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false},"Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Unless one is wealthy there is no use in being a charming fellow.

Trevor was a painter. Indeed, few people escape that nowadays. But he was also an artist, and artists are rather rare. Personally he was a strange rough fellow, with a freckled face and a red ragged beard. However, when he took up the brush he was a real master, and his pictures were eagerly sought after. He had been very much attracted by Hughie at first, it must be acknowledged, entirely on account of his personal charm. 'The only people a painter should know,' he used to say, 'are people who are bete and beautiful, people who are an artistic pleasure to look at and an intellectual repose to talk to. Men who are dandies and women who are darlings rule the world, at least they should do so.' However, after he got to know Hughie better, he liked him quite as much for his bright buoyant spirits and his generous reckless nature, and had given him the permanent entree to his studio.","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"Page 2","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false},"Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"'Come to me, my boy, when you have got ten thousand pounds of your own, and we will see about it,...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"NextChoiceId":4,"NextAnswerId":1,"QuestionID":"QID16"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_82jj9ipSJMyilee","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID17","SecondaryAttribute":"\"My aunt will be down presently, Mr. Nuttel,\" said a very self-possessed young lady of fifteen; \"...","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"\"My aunt will be down presently, Mr. Nuttel,\" said a very self-possessed young lady of fifteen; \"in the meantime you must try and put up with me.\"\n\nFramton Nuttel endeavoured to say the correct something which should duly flatter the niece of the moment without unduly discounting the aunt that was to come. Privately he doubted more than ever whether these formal visits on a succession of total strangers would do much towards helping the nerve cure which he was supposed to be undergoing.\n\n\"I know how it will be,\" his sister had said when he was preparing to migrate to this rural retreat; \"you will bury yourself down there and not speak to a living soul, and your nerves will be worse than ever from moping. I shall just give you letters of introduction to all the people I know there. Some of them, as far as I can remember, were quite nice.\"\n\nFramton wondered whether Mrs. Sappleton, the lady to whom he was presenting one of the letters of introduction came into the nice division.\n\n\"Do you know many of the people round here?\" asked the niece, when she judged that they had had sufficient silent communion.\n\n\"Hardly a soul,\" said Framton. \"My sister was staying here, at the rectory, you know, some four years ago, and she gave me letters of introduction to some of the people here.\"\n\nHe made the last statement in a tone of distinct regret.","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"Page 1\u00a0","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false},"Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"\"My aunt will be down presently, Mr. Nuttel,\" said a very self-possessed young lady of fifteen; \"...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"NextChoiceId":4,"NextAnswerId":1,"QuestionID":"QID17"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_82jj9ipSJMyilee","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID18","SecondaryAttribute":"\"Then you know practically nothing about my aunt?\" pursued the self-possessed young lady. \"Only h...","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"\"Then you know practically nothing about my aunt?\" pursued the self-possessed young lady.\n\n\"Only her name and address,\" admitted the caller. He was wondering whether Mrs. Sappleton was in the married or widowed state. An undefinable something about the room seemed to suggest masculine habitation.\n\n\"Her great tragedy happened just three years ago,\" said the child; \"that would be since your sister's time.\"\n\n\"Her tragedy?\" asked Framton; somehow in this restful country spot tragedies seemed out of place.\n\n\"You may wonder why we keep that window wide open on an October afternoon,\" said the niece, indicating a large French window that opened on to a lawn.\n\n\"It is quite warm for the time of the year,\" said Framton; \"but has that window got anything to do with the tragedy?\"\n\n\"Out through that window, three years ago to a day, her husband and her two young brothers went off for their day's shooting. They never came back. In crossing the moor to their favourite snipe-shooting ground they were all three engulfed in a treacherous piece of bog. It had been that dreadful wet summer, you know, and places that were safe in other years gave way suddenly without warning. Their bodies were never recovered. That was the dreadful part of it.\" Here the child's voice lost its self-possessed note and became falteringly human. \"Poor aunt always thinks that they will come back someday, they and the little brown spaniel that was lost with them, and walk in at that window just as they used to do. That is why the window is kept open every evening till it is quite dusk. Poor dear aunt, she has often told me how they went out, her husband with his white waterproof coat over his arm, and Ronnie, her youngest brother, singing 'Bertie, why do you bound?' as he always did to tease her, because she said it got on her nerves. Do you know, sometimes on still, quiet evenings like this, I almost get a creepy feeling that they will all walk in through that window - \"\n\nShe broke off with a little shudder. It was a relief to Framton when the aunt bustled into the room with a whirl of apologies for being late in making her appearance.\n\n\"I hope Vera has been amusing you?\" she said.\n\n\"She has been very interesting,\" said Framton.\n\n\"I hope you don't mind the open window,\" said Mrs. Sappleton briskly; \"my husband and brothers will be home directly from shooting, and they always come in this way. They've been out for snipe in the marshes today, so they'll make a fine mess over my poor carpets.

The beggar himself was standing on a raised platform in a corner of the studio. He was a wizened old man, with a face like wrinkled parchment, and a most piteous expression. Over his shoulders was flung a coarse brown cloak, all tears and tatters; his thick boots were patched and cobbled, and with one hand he leant on a rough stick, while with the other he held out his battered hat for alms.\n\n'What an amazing model!' whispered Hughie, as he shook hands with his friend.\n\n'An amazing model?' shouted Trevor at the top of his voice; 'I should think so! Such beggars as he are not to be met with every day. A trouvaille, mort cher; a living Velasquez! My stars! what an etching Rembrandt would have made of him!'\n\n'Poor old chap! said Hughie, 'how miserable he looks! But I suppose, to you painters, his face is his fortune?'\n\n'Certainly,' replied Trevor, 'you don't want a beggar to look happy, do you?'\n\n'How much does a model get for sitting?' asked Hughie, as he found himself a comfortable seat on a divan.\n\n'A shilling an hour.'\n\n'And how much do you get for your picture, Alan?'\n\n'Oh, for this I get two thousand!'\n\n'Pounds?'\n\n'Guineas. Painters, poets, and physicians always get guineas.'\n\n'Well, I think the model should have a percentage,' cried Hughie, laughing; 'they work quite as hard as you do.'\n\n'Nonsense, nonsense! Why, look at the trouble of laying on the paint alone, and standing all day long at one's easel! It's all very well, Hughie, for you to talk, but I assure you that there are moments when Art almost attains to the dignity of manual labour. But you mustn't chatter; I'm very busy. Smoke a cigarette, and keep quiet.'\n\nAfter some time the servant came in, and told Trevor that the frame-maker wanted to speak to him.\n\n'Don't run away, Hughie,' he said, as he went out, 'I will be back in a moment.'","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"Page 3","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false},"Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"When Hughie came in he found Trevor putting the finishing touches to a wonderful life-size pictur...","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"NextChoiceId":4,"NextAnswerId":1,"QuestionID":"QID39"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_82jj9ipSJMyilee","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID40","SecondaryAttribute":"The old beggar-man took advantage of Trevor's absence to rest for a moment on a wooden bench that...","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"The old beggar-man took advantage of Trevor's absence to rest for a moment on a wooden bench that was behind him. He looked so forlorn and wretched that Hughie could not help pitying him, and felt in his pockets to see what money he had. All he could find was a sovereign and some coppers. 'Poor old fellow,' he thought to himself, 'he wants it more than I do, but it means no hansoms for a fortnight;' and he walked across the studio and slipped the sovereign into the beggar's hand.\n\nThe old man started, and a faint smile flitted across his withered lips. 'Thank you, sir,' he said, 'thank you.'\n\nThen Trevor arrived, and Hughie took his leave, blushing a little at what he had done. He spent the day with Laura, got a charming scolding for his extravagance, and had to walk home.\n\nThat night he strolled into the Palette Club about eleven o'clock, and found Trevor sitting by himself in the smoking-room drinking hock and seltzer.\n\n'Well, Alan, did you get the picture finished all right?' he said, as he lit his cigarette.\n\n'Finished and framed, my boy!' answered Trevor; 'and, by-the-bye, you have made a conquest. That old model you saw is quite devoted to you. I had to tell him all about you - who you are, where you live, what your income is, what prospects you have--'\n\n'My dear Alan,' cried Hughie, 'I shall probably find him waiting for me when I go home. But of course you are only joking. Poor old wretch! I wish I could do something for him. I think it is dreadful that any one should be so miserable. I have got heaps of old clothes at home - do you think he would care for any of them? Why, his rags were falling to bits.'\n\n'But he looks splendid in them,' said Trevor. 'I wouldn't paint him in a frock-coat for anything. What you call rags I call romance. What seems poverty to you is picturesqueness to me. However, I'll tell him of your offer.'\n\n'Alan,' said Hughie seriously, 'you painters are a heartless lot.'\n\n'An artist's heart is his head,' replied Trevor; 'and besides, our business is to realise the world as we see it, not to reform it as we know it. a chacun son metier. And now tell me how Laura is. The old model was quite interested in her.'\n\n'You don't mean to say you talked to him about her?' said Hughie.\n\n'Certainly I did. He knows all about the relentless colonel, the lovely Laura, and the \u00a310,000.'\n\n'You told that old beggar all my private affairs?' cried Hughie, looking very red and angry.\n\n'My dear boy,' said Trevor, smiling, 'that old beggar, as you call him, is one of the richest men in Europe. He could buy all London to-morrow without overdrawing his account. He has a house in every capital, dines off gold plate, and can prevent Russia going to war when he chooses.'\n\n'What on earth do you mean?' exclaimed Hughie.\n\n'What I say,' said Trevor. 'The old man you saw to-day in the studio was Baron Hausberg. He is a great friend of mine, buys all my pictures and that sort of thing, and gave me a commission a month ago to paint him as a beggar. Que voulez-vous? La fantaisie d'un millionnaire!

Son affaire c'est l'argent des autres.'\n\n'I think you might have told me, Alan,' said Hughie sulkily, 'and not have let me make such a fool of myself.'\n\n'Well, to begin with, Hughie,' said Trevor, 'it never entered my mind that you went about distributing alms in that reckless way. I can understand your kissing a pretty model, but your giving a sovereign to an ugly one - by Jove, no! Besides, the fact is that I really was not at home to-day to any one; and when you came in I didn't know whether Hausberg would like his name mentioned. You know he wasn't in full dress.'\n\n'What a duffer he must think me!' said Hughie.\n\n'Not at all. He was in the highest spirits after you left; kept chuckling to himself and rubbing his old wrinkled hands together. I couldn't make out why he was so interested to know all about you; but I see it all now. He'll invest your sovereign for you, Hughie, pay you the interest every six months, and have a capital story to tell after dinner.'\n\n'I am an unlucky devil,' growled Hughie. 'The best thing I can do is to go to bed; and, my dear Alan, you mustn't tell any one. I shouldn't dare show my face in the Row.'\n\n'Nonsense!

To Framton it was all purely horrible. He made a desperate but only partially successful effort to turn the talk on to a less ghastly topic, he was conscious that his hostess was giving him only a fragment of her attention, and her eyes were constantly straying past him to the open window and the lawn beyond. It was certainly an unfortunate coincidence that he should have paid his visit on this tragic anniversary.\n\n\"The doctors agree in ordering me complete rest, an absence of mental excitement, and avoidance of anything in the nature of violent physical exercise,\" announced Framton, who laboured under the tolerably widespread delusion that total strangers and chance acquaintances are hungry for the least detail of one's ailments and infirmities, their cause and cure. \"On the matter of diet they are not so much in agreement,\" he continued.\n\n\"No?\" said Mrs. Sappleton, in a voice which only replaced a yawn at the last moment. Then she suddenly brightened into alert attention - but not to what Framton was saying.\n\n\"Here they are at last!\" she cried. \"Just in time for tea, and don't they look as if they were muddy up to the eyes!\"\n\nFramton shivered slightly and turned towards the niece with a look intended to convey sympathetic comprehension. The child was staring out through the open window with a dazed horror in her eyes. In a chill shock of nameless fear Framton swung round in his seat and looked in the same direction.\n\nIn the deepening twilight three figures were walking across the lawn towards the window, they all carried guns under their arms, and one of them was additionally burdened with a white coat hung over his shoulders. A tired brown spaniel kept close at their heels. Noiselessly they neared the house, and then a hoarse young voice chanted out of the dusk: \"I said, Bertie, why do you bound?\"\n\nFramton grabbed wildly at his stick and hat; the hall door, the gravel drive, and the front gate were dimly noted stages in his headlong retreat. A cyclist coming along the road had to run into the hedge to avoid imminent collision.\n\n\"Here we are, my dear,\" said the bearer of the white mackintosh, coming in through the window, \"fairly muddy, but most of it's dry. Who was that who bolted out as we came up?\"\n\n\"A most extraordinary man, a Mr. Nuttel,\" said Mrs. Sappleton; \"could only talk about his illnesses, and dashed off without a word of goodby or apology when you arrived. One would think he had seen a ghost.\"\n\n\"I expect it was the spaniel,\" said the niece calmly; \"he told me he had a horror of dogs. He was once hunted into a cemetery somewhere on the banks of the Ganges by a pack of pariah dogs, and had to spend the night in a newly dug grave with the creatures snarling and grinning and foaming just above him.
